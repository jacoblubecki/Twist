# Twist

What a twist? Combine Spotify playlists seamlessy.

## Idea

Ever really wanted to listen to some pop-punk with some smooth jazz mixed in? Maybe some old school
rock and roll with a dash of neurofunk.

Normally you're not really feeling the two together, but right now, you crave the combination for
some inexplicable reason. You have playlists for these things individually, but making a new
playlist for every such occasion is not worth the time or clutter it adds to your library.

Twist comes in to save the day!

Just create and name a new Twist, pick a few playlists, and watch and they magically swirl together
into a perfect concoction of genres.

## Inspiration

I created a bunch of playlists based on family and friends personal tastes, as well as songs that
held specific historic or emotional importance to me related to those people. I then thought, "it
would be really cool if I could mix these together when I'm driving around with these people." So
now I made this, to make that easier.

## Features

Very flexible fusion options, from simply running a few playlists together to supplementing their
content to balance the tastes of each playlist. The ideas are in the works but not entirely fleshed
out just yet. The README will get updates as the spec changes and becomes more refined.
